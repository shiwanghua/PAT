### Part A

* I think loop B is faster, because a[0] and a[1] can increase in parallel.
* For loop A, the second operation depends on the first operation.
* By running the test program, loop A use 997231437 instructions while loop B use 1118833676 without O3 optimization.
* In conclusion, loop A is faster.

### Part B

* I think Situation 2 is faster, because the addresses have a difference of 64 B which is more friend to 64 bit operating system.
* In situation 2, one thread may occupy 0ï½ž3 position in the cache so that the concurrency is invalid.
* Besides, according to the experiment result, situation 1 use 5166.6 ms while situation 2 use 101.9 ms on my computer.
